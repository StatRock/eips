<h2>2019 EIPS Exhibit at the Art Museum of Eastern Idaho</h2>
<p>EIPS has an upcoming photo exhibit with the Art Museum. Our photos will be displayed in the Studio Gallery from May 21st through July 6th, 2019. </p>
<p>Staff at the Art Museum told us they need approximately 20-25 photos to fill the space, depending on the size of the photos. An email was sent out on Apri1 10 with a list of people who have signed up to provide pictures.  You are invited to check the list; if you do not have the email, you can get it from <a href="mailto:lazaruslong1966@gmail.com"> Steve Spring</a>.  The people on the list will each be displaying two photos.  </p>
<p>If you are submitting photos, you must email the following information about each photo to <a href="mailto:lazaruslong1966@gmail.com"> Steve Spring </a>before Friday, April 19:
 (1) Title; (2) Type of medium (e.g., Photography); (3) Actual size dimensions (outside boundary of picture); and (4) Price. The Art Museum retains 25% of the price of any sold goods.  Omitting the price will cause the picture to be labeled "Not for Sale."  The Art Museum uses the requested information to make labels for each picture.</p>
<p>Recall that photos are limited to a height of 42 inches including frames. The Museum accepts metal photos, gallery wrapped photos, and photos that are wired for hanging.  Call Steve at 208-709-8580 if you have any questions.</p>
