<h2>2019 EIPS Exhibit at the Art Museum of Eastern Idaho</h2>
<p>EIPS has an upcoming photo exhibit with the Art Museum. Our photos will be displayed in the Studio Gallery from May 21st through July 6th, 2019. </p>
<p>Staff at the Art Museum told us they need approximately 20-25 photos to fill the space, depending on the size of the photos. We are tentatively anticipating that participating members might be able to submit 2-3 photos depending on how many people participate in the exhibit.</p> 
<p>Right now we are doing an informal survey to identify how many members are interested in participating. If you are interested in submitting one or more photos, please respond by email to <a href="mailto:lazaruslong1966@gmail.com"> Steve Spring </a> by Sunday, March 31st, indicating the number of photos you would like to submit (1, 2, or 3). Please understand that if more members are interested than initially anticipated, the number of photos that can be submitted from each individual might change.</p>
<p>Once we have an informal count of participation we will let members know how many photos can be submitted. The maximum height for photos (including mat/frame) is 42 inches. There are no listed restrictions on width. Artwork has to be properly framed or gallery wrapped and wired for hanging. Since Art Museum personnel will be making tags for each of the photos, they will need to know the titles a week or two before the exhibit opens.</p>
<p>We will be dropping photos off on Saturday, May 18th (11 a.m. To 4 p.m.).  The dates for picking the photos up are July 8th or 9th from 11 a.m. To 5 p.m.</p>
<p>We will be finalizing our participation in the TAM photo show at our April 1 meeting.  Remember that annual club dues ($25) must be paid in full by April 15 in order to participate in the exhibit.</p>
