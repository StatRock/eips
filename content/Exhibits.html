<h2>Exhibit Opportunities for EIPS Members</h2>
<p class="DefaultText" style="text-align:left">&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society is active in promoting the display of member images in a number of venues.  In its over 25 years of existence the EIPS has had over 250 shows/presentations of photography to the public in Idaho Falls. We have presented over 3400 images shown to the public in these shows.</p>
<p>A primary display activity usually occurs either in late October/November, or after the annual October show is judged. Pictures are usually open for public viewing for most of the months of October and November in the hallways of the main College of Eastern Idaho Administration Building, 1600 S 25th E, Building&nbsp;3.  We regret that this exhibit in not in place for 2018 because we did not have sufficient resources.</p>
