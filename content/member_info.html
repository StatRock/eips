<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>Below are some factoids about the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society.</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>The club was established in 1989</li>
    <li>The first meeting of the year is the club's annual banquet dinner.  The club provides the entree, and members bring potluck side dishes.  At the banquet, awards are given based on scoring from the monthly critiques.  Also plans for the forthcoming year are discussed.</li>
    <li>Individual/family dues are $25/year, paid at the start of each year (typically paid at the annual the club banquet). Dues cover club expenses such as paying fees for participation in the Idaho Falls Art Council Art Walk.  Monthly critique scores are saved for club members.</li>
    <li>Elections for club officers occur in December of each year.  The offices are President, Vice-President, and Secretary-Treasurer.  Other offices are established as needed, such as program chairman or webmaster.  The set of officers constitutes the club board.</li>    
  </ul>

<h3> Business Meetings</h3>
<p>The club has no formal business meetings.  Club business issues are generally addressed at the start of the workshop meetings. Sometimes, decisions are made at meetings of the club board. The following topics are currrently on the table for discussion and decision-making:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Themes for the monthly critiques for 2018</li>
  <li>Workshop topics and photo shoot locations for 2018</li>
  <li>Whether to switch the two monthly meetings so that the critique meeting occurs first.  That choice would move the photo shoot outings so that they do not confict with the Idaho Falls Art Council Art Walks, which occur on the first Thursday of the month during May through October.</li>
  <li>Whether we want to participate in the Art Walks in 2018.  Participation requires members to have framed photos for exhibit for each of the six months, requires a member representative to be at the photo exhibit each month, and also requires that the club pay a fee to help cover Art Council expenses.</li>
</ul>
