<h2>Activities Overview</h2>
<h3>October Show</h3>
<p>In addition to the bimonthly meetings, the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society is active in promoting the display of member images in a number of venues.  A primary activity is to sponsor a photo exposition or show each year.  The show entries are judged by professional photographers.  Also, for the shows, club members find sponsors who provide gift certificates and other awards for the best entries. The pictures are open for public viewing for most of the month of October or November in the hallways of the main Eastern Idaho College Adminsitration Building, 1600 S 25th E, Building 3.</p>

<h3>Field Trips</h3>
<p>Another area of club activity is field trips.  These can occur on weekends or other times when members are free to gather and travel to a more distant location than is possible during a regular first Thursday meeting night.  There have been no recent trips of this nature, but the link below describes some past locations that have been visited by the club and thus gives ideas for possible future ones.  The link also leads to field trip information, such as maps and websites containing weather information.</p>

<h3>Other Activities</h3>
<p> EIPS members also enjoy other activities, such as an annual club dinner where awards are presented for achievements earned during the second Thursday "Advancement" meetings.  Club members have been known to help at area school science fairs and Earth Day. </p>
