<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>At the first Thursday monthly meetings, EIPS members sometimes go on outings or take pictures under conditions arranged at the meeting site such as pictures of objects under special lighting.  Presentations are another possible activity, especially when the weather is too cold for picture taking outside.  Sometimes guest speakers are invited.  At other times, members pass photo tips to the rest of the club by making presentations.</p>
