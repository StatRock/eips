<h2>2017 October Exposition</h2>
<p>For 2017, the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society had an exposition instead of a show.  The 2017 October Exposition was in the hallways of the Administration Building (Building #3) at the College of Eastern Idaho.  Pictures were submitted by both members and non-members. The exhibit ran from October 25 to November 29, 2017.  People's choice awards were given to the photographers with the most popular photos.</p>
