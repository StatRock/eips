<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society (EIPS) of Idaho Falls, Idaho, is a photography club for amateur and professional photographers. Now is an excellent time to join us as we envision a new future for our club.</p>  
<p>Most of the descriptions in this website are about what we have done in the past. We expect to continue those types of activities, such as sharing our experiences and ideas about places to go, photo tips, etc.; having informal presentations and hands-on workshops about methods for taking pictures and for enhancing them afterwards; holding friendly photo critiques where we view pictures and consider possible improvements; and displaying our photographic art in public venues.  Of course, we also like to go out and take pictures!</p>
<p>We want to pursue these activities in a flexible and open framework, driven by the particular interests of the members.  In the past, for example, we have sponsored an annual October juried show with framed photos.  We may decide to let that go.  Conversely, we have had only local excursions in recent years (to sites we can visit in the course of an evening meeting); no field trips on weekends to more distant sites.  We are open to changing these activities as desired by our members.</p>

<h2>Meeting Time and Location</h2>
<p>Our meetings usually occur on the first and third Monday at 7:00 p.m. There may be a few cases when the weather is nice and we meet to take pictures at some photogenic spot, but generally we meet at The Bridge Club, 1421 Benton St. in Idaho Falls.  Benton Street is just one block long, west of St. Clair and a half-block north of 9th St. The Bridge Club building is a blond brick building sitting back from the street on the north side, a half-block west of St. Clair. See the middle pin on the <a href="/BridgeClubMap.html">Bridge Club Map</a> for more directions.</p>
<h2>Upcoming Meeting Activities</h2>
<p>Usually we do friendly critiques on the first Monday meeting and have talks and workshops on the second Monday meeting.  The second Monday is also a time when we may meet for a photo shoot at a nearby location.  In those cases, we may meet before 7 pm, at the location.  We include the trip leader's phone number in the trip announcement e-mails so that if you can't arrive on time, you can text or call to find out exactly where we are.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/EIPScalendar.html">Calendar</a> for specific activities on particular meeting dates.  The other way to know exactly what is planned for particular meetings is to be on our e-mail list.  Send an e-mail to the <a href="mailto:eipsif@gmail.com">Club President</a>  requesting to be added to the list.  The club president sends out a note a few days before each meeting.</p>

<h2>News&#8212;New Officers & Next Meeting</h2>
<p>The officers for 2020 are:  Shannon Bowman, President; Steve Spring, Vice-president; Marva Carroll, Secretary; and Denise Spring, Treasurer.  </p>
<p>Our next meeting is March 2, 2020, at 7 p.m.  We will vote on a new set of Bylaws, which have been forwarded to our members and friends for review.  Then there will be a demonstration and workshop on product photography.  Bring your cameras and tripods and learn about the best ways to photograph products that you want to sell.  Learn abouat camera angles, settings, and lighting for showing off your treasures.</p>
<p>Lately, we have been having just one meeting per month.  Please bring your meeting ideas for upcoming months on March 2. What do you want to do?  Where do you want to go? These ideas will help us get back on track with our normal twice/month schedule and have more photography education and fun.</p>

<h2>Overview of Normal Ongoing Activities</h2>
<p>We expect to continue doing most of the activities described below.  We are reevaluating the schedule and how often we perform them. </p>
<p>The first monthly meeting focused on photo critiques.  We entertained each other with our photos by bringing them for review by the group.  We projected the photos and briefly discussed them.  The critiques are positive and designed to improve our skills as photographers.</p>

<p> The second meeting of the month was either an educational presentation, workshop, or excursion to a nearby site for taking pictures.  We entertained each other with our practice of photography.  It is always good to bring your camera and tripod to these meetings. The educational presentations often introduce us to new ways to enhance our photographs using computer software. EIPS members also enjoy taking still-life pictures and experimenting with light.  Many of the workshops involved staging objects and taking pictures at the meeting site. </p>
<p>For the excursions, we sometimes met at the site; but other times we met locally and went in carpools to the selected site. Being on our email list keeps us informed about the excursion specifics. The choice of activity often depends on the weather!</p>

<p>Exhibiting our pictures is another major activity of the EIPS.  We have participated in the summertime monthly Gallery Walk sponsored by the Idaho Falls Art Council.  We have displayed our photos at other public sites such as the College of Eastern Idaho.  We have conducted annual expositions or shows in the fall.  The shows have been judged by professional photographers.</p>

<p>The club also hosts field trips from time to time, on weekends or other times when members are able to gather and travel a bit further for picture-taking.  We are privileged to live an a place where the beauty of the natural world in many different forms is nearby.</p>
