<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The Eastern Idaho Photographic Society (EIPS) of Idaho Falls, Idaho, is a photography club for amateur and professional photographers. We enjoy sharing our experiences and ideas about places to go, photo tips, etc.; having presentations and hands-on workshops about methods for taking pictures and for enhancing them afterwards; holding friendly photo critiques where we view pictures and consider possible improvements; and displaying our photographic art in public venues.  Of course, we also like to go out and take pictures!</p>
  <div class="center alert"><p>ALERT: <br>
    ALL ROUTINE INDOOR ACTIVITIES ARE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED, UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, DUE TO COVID&ndash;19.</p> </div>
    <hr class="short" />
    <div class="center blackAlert"><p>HOWEVER, activities that support social distancing and safety continue, and we have a NEW opportunity for safe photography interactions and learning.</p></div>
  <p>Our COVID-safe activities fall into 4 categories:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Field trips.</strong>   We go to photographic sites where social distancing can be maintained, generally once/month. Sometimes a member coordinates and leads the trip.</li>
  <li><strong>Opportunities to critique our photographs using the internet.</strong> We submit pictures to the club Facebook Group or Flicker page. In either of these cases, we submit review commments on one or more photos that others in the group have posted on these sites.</li> 
  <li><strong>(NEW) Participation in ZOOM meetings with another photography club.</strong> The Kitsap Photography Guild (KPG) is a photography club in Washington State which is part of the West [Puget] Sound Photography Group (<a href="http://www.kitsapphotographyguild.com">KPG link</a>). Its regular meetings, available only to club members, are held on the third Thursday of the month at 8 p.m. (Idaho time).</li> 
  <li><strong>Public displays of our photographs.</strong> We participate in public displays as the opportunities arise.  Recently we exhibited in the "Collective" show at the Art Museum of Eastern Idaho. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>  For more information on each of these current and ongoing activities, see our Facebook pages (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/EIPSID/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/608801283273390/">Facebook Group</a>) and our Flicker page (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/14716430@N21/">Flicker</a>). You may also want to get on the club's e-mail list.  Send an e-mail to the <a href="mailto:eipsif@gmail.com">EIPS</a> with your name and request.

<h2>Meeting Time and Location<br>
  (before & after COVID-19)</h2>
<p>Our meetings usually occur on the first and third Monday at 7:00 p.m. There may be a few cases when the weather is nice and we meet to take pictures at some photogenic spot, but generally we meet at The Bridge Club, 1421 Benton St. in Idaho Falls.  Benton Street is just one block long, west of St. Clair and a half-block north of 9th St. The Bridge Club building is a blond brick building sitting back from the street on the north side, a half-block west of St. Clair. See the middle pin on the <a href="/BridgeClubMap.html">Bridge Club Map</a> for more directions.</p>
<h2>Routine Meeting Activities<br>
  (temporarily suspended)</h2>
<p>Usually we do friendly critiques on the first Monday meeting and have talks and workshops on the second Monday meeting.  The second Monday is also a time when we may meet for a photo shoot at a nearby location.  In those cases, we may meet before 7 pm, at the location.  We include the trip leader's phone number in the trip announcement e-mails so that if you can't arrive on time, you can text or call to find out exactly where we are.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/EIPScalendar.html">Calendar</a> for specific activities on particular meeting dates.  The other way to know exactly what is planned for particular meetings is to be on our e-mail list.  Send an e-mail to the <a href="mailto:eipsif@gmail.com">Club President</a>  requesting to be added to the list.  The club president sends out a note a few days before each meeting.</p>

<h2>Overview of Normal Ongoing Activities<br>
  (currently suspended)</h2>
<p>We expect to continue doing most of the activities described below.  We are reevaluating the schedule and how often we perform them. </p>
<p>The first monthly meeting focused on photo critiques.  We entertained each other with our photos by bringing them for review by the group.  We projected the photos and briefly discussed them.  The critiques are positive and designed to improve our skills as photographers.</p>
<a href="/critique_program.html">Critique Program</a>
<p> The second meeting of the month was either an educational presentation, workshop, or excursion to a nearby site for taking pictures.  We entertained each other with our practice of photography.  It is always good to bring your camera and tripod to these meetings. The educational presentations often introduce us to new ways to enhance our photographs using computer software. EIPS members also enjoy taking still-life pictures and experimenting with light.  Many of the workshops involved staging objects and taking pictures at the meeting site. </p>
<p>For the excursions, we sometimes met at the site; but other times we met locally and went in carpools to the selected site. Being on our email list keeps us informed about the excursion specifics. The choice of activity often depends on the weather!</p>

<p>Exhibiting our pictures is another major activity of the EIPS.  We have participated in the summertime monthly Gallery Walk sponsored by the Idaho Falls Art Council.  We have displayed our photos at other public sites such as the College of Eastern Idaho.  We have conducted annual expositions or shows in the fall.  The shows have been judged by professional photographers.</p>

<p>The club also has hosted field trips from time to time, on weekends or other times when members are able to gather and travel a bit further for picture-taking.  We are privileged to live an a place where the beauty of the natural world in many different forms is nearby.</p>
