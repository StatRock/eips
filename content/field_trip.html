<h2>Field Trips</h2>
<p> From time to time, the Eastern Idaho Photographic Society goes on field trips that take more time than just an evening meeting.  There are many excellent locations for picture-taking in the area around Idaho Falls.  Although there have been no recent field trips, in the past the club has gone to many different sites.  Members also like to photograph special events. The lists below show some of the places and events, grouped roughly by what you see depending on what route you take leaving Idaho Falls.  The link at the bottom of the page provides links to websites for many of these locations.</p>
