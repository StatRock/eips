## Tutorials/information about Markdown (md) Language

The readme file and several other documentation files in this project are written in "Markdown."  Markdown is a text editing language for which all formatting is described in text. It is recommended because it is simple and it allows the writer to focus exclusively on the content.  Although many people like the apparent simplicity of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, such editors do not inform the writer about everything being specified in the formatting.  In something like Markdown, the writer always sees what is going on.  There can't be any invisible formatting commands, because all formatting commands *must* be visible.
Most modern text editors like 

* visualstudiocode -- https://code.visualstudio.com/
* atom -- https://atom.io/
* scrivener -- https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php
* emacs -- https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
* Sublime Text -- https://www.sublimetext.com/ 

either support or have plugins that support markdown.  Many of these plugins even include a preview function (not that you really need tool support to edit markdown).  Most web authoring tools and platforms such as WordPress support Markdown as well.

There are many excellent tools for markdown editing itself, including some WYSIWYGs.  Here are two examples.
